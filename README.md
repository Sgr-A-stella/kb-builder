# Knowledge Base Builder - experiment to integrate some knowledge representations 
(is possible /within sight/ knowledge representation examples: vectorsemantics /extended to hyperpolytopes/, knowledge graphs and/or relatives, formal logics, M² paradigm)

### Motivations
Current mainstream knowledge representations of genAI systems (as vectorsemantics, prompts and RAG background embeddings /as mostly based vectorsemantics too/) are insufficient alone to achieve cogAI, that is cognitive level AI.
(cogAI := collective noun of human cognition based, deep understanding targeted AIs)

### Goals
1. Build an persistent, queriable, maintainable (content-modifiable and -expandable) store from some formats of documents.
2. Provide API for update and upload content to store, as well as query informations from store.

### Requirements
- Integrate as many as possible knowledge representations from the list below:
  - vectorsemantics /extended to hyperpolytopes/
  - knowledge graphs and/or relatives /mind maps, semantic nets, ontologies,... etc./
  - formal logics /not only classical, but modal, temporal, many-valued, fuzzy,... etc./
  - M² paradigm /mental patterns & models/
  - ... etc
- Input: documents with some file formats /pdf, epub,... etc./
- Persistent store to background storage by store-manager(s) /maybe multiparadigm DB server or multple DB servers with different paradigms: relation, vector, graph,... etc./
- REST endpoint for API with functionalities update, upload and several queries
